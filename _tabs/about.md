# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Re3on**!  
I'm currently a student at **PTIT**, passionate about **cybersecurity**.  
I enjoy building some shitty projects, exploring new technologies, and constantly learning.
I do some CTF Challenge with my team [SECJOTA](https://ctftime.org/team/354523), our best ranking is 850 Worldwide - 43 Vietnam.
