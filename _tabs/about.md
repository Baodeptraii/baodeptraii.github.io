# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm **Re3on**!  
I'm currently a student at **PTIT**, passionate about **cybersecurity**.  
I enjoy building some shitty projects, exploring new technologies, and constantly learning.
I do some CTF Challenge with my team [SECJOTA](https://ctftime.org/team/354523), we are trying to get into Vietnam's leaderboard ranking.

# ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact

I love random facts and memes.  
Hereâ€™s one: the first computer bug was literally a **moth** stuck in a relay!
